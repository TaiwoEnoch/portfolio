    review: `Enoch is one of the most committed and skillful developers I've had the pleasure of working with at Microverse. He's super dedicated to his craft, which is exciting and motivating! He's always right on schedule, fancies standard/best coding practices, and has impeccable eyes for perfection - not minding a few requests for changes.

    He's positive in demeanor, highly collaborative as a team member, and a good communicator.
    
    I'd recommend working with Enoch.
    
    He's going to make things happen, never been so sure of someone. I hope he finds a matching organization that will put his fertile skills to use.`,
